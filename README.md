# Neutrinos-Physics-Beyond-the-Standard-Model-and-Lessons-from-IceCube

Neutrinos, a class of elementary particles with close to no mass that interact with only the weak nuclear and gravitational forces, possess a remarkable ability to traverse enormous distances without interference. Originating from processes like nuclear fusion in stars, supernova explosions, supermassive blackholes and radioactive decay, neutrinos are unique in their capacity to journey through space largely undisturbed. This characteristic helps answer some of the most fundamental questions about the universe such as the inner workings of astrophysical bodies and potentially the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. By reviewing data from IceCube, the world's largest optical Cherenkov telescope, this paper presents information from a major identified source of astrophysical neutrinos: blazars. This paper also discusses the importance of multi messenger astrophysics in understanding the complex nature of neutrino emissions, antineutrino characteristics, and blazars.
